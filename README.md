# Markdown Magic

This script was built with my dotfiles in mind. It converts some of the html
pages that the `help.sh` script gives as output.

You need to give as argument the `site` and `url` to be converted. By now, it
expects 2 possible sites:

- `stackexchange`: the `help.sh` make a request to the stack exchange's api
  using the [querystack](https://github.com/felipe-goes/querystack) program.
  Using the url generated by `querystack` the `mdmagic` can convert the output
  into markdown.
- `cppbyexample`: the `help.sh` make a request to [cppbyexample](https://cppbyexample.com/).
  Using the url generated the `mdmagic` can convert the output into markdown.
